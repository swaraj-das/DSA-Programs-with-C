# DSA Programs with C

Welcome to the **DSA Programs** repository! This repository contains various programs demonstrating important data structure and algorithm (DSA) concepts.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Deletion Operation** - Programs showcasing deletion operations in different data structures.
- **Queue** - Programs demonstrating queue operations, including insertion, deletion, and display functions and circular queue. 
- **Stack** - Stack-based programs, including postfix evaluation.
- **Binary Search** - Implementation of binary search.
- **Linear Search** - Implementation of linear search.

## 💻 Programs Overview

### **Deletion Operation**
1. `array.c` - Deletion in arrays with static memory allocation.
2. `malloc.c` - Deletion in arrays with dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()`.

### **Queue**  

1. `linearQ.c` - Program which shows insertion, deletion, display of a linear array based queue.  
2. `circular-queue.c` - Program which shows insertion, deletion, display of a circular array based queue.  

### **Stack**
1. `bin-to-dec.c` - Binary to decimal number converter using stack.
2. `infix-to-postfix.c` - Infix to postfix conversion using stack.
3. `postfix-evaluation.c` - Postfix evaluation using stack.
4. `reverse_string.c` - Stack application for reversing strings.
5. `stack.c` - Basic stack operations implementation.

### **Search**
1. `binary_search-recursive.c` - Recursive implementation of binary search.
2. `binary_search.c` - Iterative implementation of binary search.

### **Linear Search**
1. `array.c` - Linear Search in arrays with static memory allocation.
2. `malloc.c` - Linear Search in arrays with dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()`.
