- **Linear Search** - Implementation of linear search.

## 💻 Programs Overview

### **Deletion Operation**
1. `array.c` - Deletion in arrays with static memory allocation.
2. `malloc.c` - Deletion in arrays with dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()`.

### **Stack**
1. `bin-to-dec.c` - Binary to decimal number converter using stack.
2. `infix-to-postfix.c` - Infix to postfix conversion using stack.
3. `postfix-evaluation.c` - Postfix evaluation using stack.
4. `reverse_string.c` - Stack application for reversing strings.
5. `stack.c` - Basic stack operations implementation.
